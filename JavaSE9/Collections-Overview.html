<h3 class="section">13.1 Collections Overview</h3>
<a name="index-Collections-overview"></a>
<a name="index-J2SE-1_002e2"></a>
<a name="index-Dictionary"></a>
<a name="index-Vector"></a>
<a name="index-Stack"></a>
<a name="index-Properties"></a>

<p>The Java Collections Framework standardizes the way in whcih groups of
objects are handled by programs.  Collections were not part of the original
Java release, but were added by J2SE 1.2.  Prior to the Collections
Framework, Java provided ad hoc classes such as <samp>Dictionary</samp>,
<samp>Vector</samp>, <samp>Stack</samp>, and <samp>Properties</samp> to stored and manipulate
groups of objects.  These classes lacked a central unifying theme.  The way
that you used <samp>Vector</samp> was different from the way that you used
<samp>Properties</samp>.  This early, ad hoc approach was not designed to be easily
extended or adapted.  Collections were an answer to these (and other)
problems.
</p>
<a name="Collections-Goals"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Collections Goals</h4>
<a name="index-Collections-Framekwork-goals"></a>

<p>The Collections Framework was designed to meet several goals.  <em>First</em>,
the framework had to be high-performance.  The implementations for the
fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash
tables) are highly efficient.  You seldom, if ever, need to code one of these
&ldquo;data engines&rdquo; manually.  <em>Second</em>, the framework had to allow
different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high
degree of interoperability.  <em>Third</em>, extending and/or adapting a
collection had to be easy.  Toward this end, the entire Collections Framework
is built upon a set of standard interfaces.  Several standard implementations
(such as <samp>LinkedList</samp>, <samp>HashSet</samp>, and <samp>TreeSet</samp> of these
interfaces are provided that you may use as-is.  You may also implement your
own collection.  Various special-purpose implementations are created for your
convenience, and some partial implementations are provided that make creating
your own collection class easier.  <em>Finally</em>, mechanisms were added that
allow the integration of standard arrays into the Collections Framework.

<a name="Algorithms"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Algorithms</h4>
<a name="index-Algorithms_002c-Collections-Framework"></a>

<p><em>Algorithms</em> are another important part of the collection mechanism.
Algorithms operate on collections and are defined as static methods within
the <samp>Collections</samp> class.  Thus, they are available for all collections.
Each collection class need not implement its own versions.  The algorithms
provide a standard means of manipulating collections.
</p>
<a name="Iterator-Interface"></a>
<h4 class="subheading"><samp>Iterator</samp> Interface</h4>
<a name="index-Iterator-interface"></a>
<a name="index-iterator"></a>

<p>Antoher item closely associated with the Collections Framework is the
<samp>Iterator</samp> interface.  An <em>iterator</em> offers a general-purpose
standardized way of accessing the elements within a collection, one at a
time.  Thus, an iterator provides a means of <em>enumerating the contents
of a collection</em>.  Because each collection provides an iterator, the elements
of any collection class can be accessed through the methods defined by
<samp>Iterator</samp>.  Thus, with only small changes, the code that cycles through
a set can also be used to cycle through a list.
</p>
<a name="Splitarator"></a>
<h4 class="subheading"><samp>Splitarator</samp></h4>
<a name="index-Spliterator"></a>
<a name="index-PrimitiveIterator"></a>
<a name="index-PrimitiveIterator_002eOfDouble"></a>
<a name="index-JDK-8-1"></a>
<a name="index-primitive-type-iterators"></a>
<a name="index-iterators_002c-primitive-types"></a>

<p>JDK 8 added another type of iterator called a <em>spliterator</em>.  These are
iterators that provide support for parallel iteration.  The interfaces that
support spliterators are <samp>Spliterator</samp> and several nested interfaces
that support primitive types.  JDK 8 also added iterator interfaces designed
for use with primitive types such as <samp>PrimitiveIterator</samp> and
<samp>PrimitiveIterator.OfDouble</samp>.  
</p>
<a name="Map-Interfaces-and-Classes"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Map Interfaces and Classes</h4>
<a name="index-maps"></a>
<a name="index-collection_002dview-of-a-map"></a>

<p>In addition to collections, the framework defines several map interfaces and
classes.  <em>Maps</em> store key/value pairs.  Although maps are part of the
Collections Framework, they are not &ldquo;collections&rdquo; in the strict use of the
term.  You can, however, obtain a <em>collection-view</em> of a map.  Such a
view contains the elements from the map stored in a collection.  Thus, you
can process the contents of a map as a collection.
